Title: **Forecasting Product Quantity for the Upcoming Quarter Using Time Series Analysis**

Description:

Time-series analysis is a statistical method used to analyze data collected over a period of time. In this context, this method is used to forecast the quantity of products that will be sold in the next quarter. By analyzing historical data on product sales, trends, and seasonal patterns, time-series analysis can provide valuable information about the quantity of products that will be sold in a specific time period. Thus, this information can be used by companies to plan production and manage inventory more effectively, thereby optimizing the production process and increasing profits.
